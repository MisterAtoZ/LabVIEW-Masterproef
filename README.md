# Labview program

The main program is located in LabView test -> labviewArduino_2.vi

This vi contains the program for the full setup (switch matrix, High voltage source and Keithley 2400). In the measure state, the settings for the Keithley 2400 can be found. If another measuring device needs to be connected, it can be done in this state.
